[dependencies]
# bevy is at 0.14.0-rc.4 which does not have BRP support, so we're just gonna use a monkeypatched branch
# https://github.com/knutsoned/bevy/tree/brp-rc.4
#
# it needs to be in the same location sickle is looking for it which is 2 levels up
#
# when 0.14.0 comes out, we'll have to rebase on that
#
# hypothetically, at that point, both this project and sickle should be able to use a careful git fork of the release
# with the BRP changes replayed on top
